# ImgurApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

The purpse of creating this app is to display photos from imgur gallery by using imgur api.

## Run
npm install
ng serve

!better don't run it during this period as this is a initial stage, without any nice style as well as nice album

<hr />

## Current Issue

* not familar with imgur api and has spent a lot of time to find a nice gallery,  can only using the default one at this moment to try if angular functioned well.
* have a thought of creating my own nice album and display it, will do more research on it 
* will add more styles FOR SURE....
